# Project-as-a-package


## Summary

[ProjectAsPackage](https://www.github.com/waldronlab/ProjectAsPackage) provides a template for generating reproducible analyses as an R package. Why? Using an R package has some advantages:

* You can separate re-usable functions from your analysis, and have help pages for these functions. You can also use help pages as "codebooks" for the datasets.
* You can include data and code in the same package. If the data are somewhat big, you can use [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/). 
* You can automatically install all needed packages when installing this package, just by adding these packages to the "Depends" section or "Imports" section of the DESCRIPTION file.
* You can have one or more `.Rmd` files in the "vignettes" directory that reproduce your analysis, and take advantage of rmarkdown caching to speed up running them.
* You can use a local package or GitHub private repo before you are ready to make your code/data public. Then once you publish on GitHub, your analysis will be both easily reproducible and professional-looking.

## The data

[ProjectAsPackage](https://www.github.com/waldronlab/ProjectAsPackage) demonstrates setup for analyzing published data from:

> Chou B, Krill LS, Horton BB, Barat CE, Trimble CL:
> Disparities in human papillomavirus vaccine completion among
> vaccine initiators. Obstet. Gynecol. 2011, 118:14â€“20.

## How to make your own copy of ProjectAsPackage on GitHub

Click on "[Use this template](https://github.com/waldronlab/ProjectAsPackage/generate)" to create a new GitHub repo starting with this code. 

[ProjectAsPackage](https://www.github.com/waldronlab/ProjectAsPackage) is set up as a GitHub "template" allowing you to initiate a new repository with it as the starting point for a new analysis. [Transfer to your own GitHub repo](https://github.com/waldronlab/ProjectAsPackage/generate).

## Building

Building is most easily done using the "Build" menu in [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/). Building roxygen documentation requires the [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html) package.

## pkgdown to make a web page

To easily publish your package and analysis as a web site using [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/pkgdown.html) (publicly on GitHub-pages or locally), you can use commands in the script [update.sh](https://github.com/waldronlab/ProjectAsPackage/blob/master/update.sh). This very short script runs the command `pkgdown::build_site(lazy=TRUE)`. 

You can customize the website with the [_pkgdown.yml](https://github.com/waldronlab/ProjectAsPackage/blob/master/_pkgdown.yml) file using instructions from [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/pkgdown.html).

**To activate GitHub pages**, from your GitHub repo you need to click on "Settings" on the top toolbar, scroll down to "GitHub Pages", then change "None - Disable GitHub Pages" to "master branch /docs folder". You should now see the URL for your new web page here.  If you can't select this option, it's because you haven't yet pushed a master branch docs folder created by pkgdown to GitHub.
